Part 1: Describe how you would build a logistic regression model to predict the probability of a bid winning (win) based on the other columns. What features would you select and why?

Answer  :

I'll eliminate the rows that have missing bidder.
I'll impute the numeric columns.
I'll perform EDA. Scatter plots for numeric features with the target and box plots for categorical features. 
Based on the EDA and correlation heatmap, I'll select features.
I'll select columns: bidder, size,ad_unit, request_count, sum_time_to_respond, avg_bid( based on the correlation with the target and since median bid has a lot of nulls) as my features
here bidder and size are categorical columns hence I'll go for OHE and for numerical columns I'll firstly replace outliers and then scale them.
I'll transorm the target 'win_count' to 1 or o. If win then 1 else 0.
I'll run a logistic regression model as follows:
a) Splitting the dataset into test and train (80:20).
b) Using Stratified k-fold for cross validation
   c) Work with a Logistic Regression model with class_weight parameter as 'balanced'
   d) I'll finally check for metrics like accuracy, precision, etc. 

Reason for selecting features:
1) Bidder affects the rate of winning the bid as seen in the data (Q1)
2) size is likely to have a good correlation with the target (As the bid depends of the size of ad)
3) ad_unit,request_count, sum_time_to_respond, avg_bid are important numeric features that affect the win probability in an auction.



Part 2: Based on the following results from a logistic regression model  trained on the dataset, interpret the coefficients:
bid_amount: Coefficient = 0.8
time_to_bid: Coefficient = -0.4
ad_unit_A: Coefficient = 0.3 (reference category: ad_unit_B)
Answer:

If the coeff of bid_amount = 0.8.
It means that 1 unit increase in the bid_amount(by 1$) would increase the log loss of the target by 1.

If the coeff of time_to_bid = -0.4.
It means that 1 unit increase in the time_to_bid(1 unit increase in time ) would decrease the log loss of the target by 1.

If the coeff of ad_unit_A = 0.3.
It means that if the ad_unit is of category A, then there would be an increase in the log loss of the target by 1.
